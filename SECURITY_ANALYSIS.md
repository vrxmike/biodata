# Security Analysis: Nodemailer Vulnerability (GHSA-mm7p-fcc7-pg87)

## Summary
A **moderate severity** security vulnerability has been identified in the `nodemailer` package used by this project. This vulnerability allows emails to be misrouted to unintended domains due to an email parsing interpretation conflict.

## Vulnerability Details

### Advisory Information
- **GHSA ID**: GHSA-mm7p-fcc7-pg87
- **Severity**: Moderate (CVSS 4.0 Score: 5.5)
- **Affected Package**: nodemailer
- **Affected Versions**: < 7.0.7
- **Fixed Version**: >= 7.0.7
- **Current Version in Project**: ^6.9.12
- **CWE Classifications**: 
  - CWE-20: Improper Input Validation
  - CWE-436: Interpretation Conflict

### Technical Description
The vulnerability occurs in nodemailer's email parsing library, which incorrectly handles quoted local-parts containing the `@` symbol. This leads to misrouting of email recipients, where the parser extracts and routes to an unintended domain instead of following RFC-5321/5322 compliant behavior.

#### Example Attack Vector
```javascript
// Malicious payload
const to = '"xclow3n@gmail.com x"@internal.domain';
```

In this example:
- **RFC-Compliant Parsing**: Should send to `"xclow3n@gmail.com x"@internal.domain`
- **Actual Behavior**: Sends to `xclow3n@gmail.com` (external domain)

### Security Impact

1. **Data Leakage**: Sensitive emails intended for internal domains may be sent to external, unintended recipients
2. **Filter Evasion**: Anti-spam systems and email logs may be bypassed by hiding recipients inside quoted local-parts
3. **Compliance Issues**: Violates RFC 5321/5322 email parsing standards
4. **Access Control Bypass**: Domain-based access controls can be circumvented

## Impact on This Project

### Affected Files
The following files in this project use `nodemailer`:

1. **`/server/controllers/authController.js`**
   - Function: `requestPasswordReset()`
   - Usage: Sends password reset emails
   - Risk: Password reset emails could be sent to unintended external domains

2. **`/server/controllers/registrationController.js`**
   - Function: `registerUser()`
   - Function: `resendVerificationEmail()`
   - Usage: Sends email verification links
   - Risk: Email verification links could be sent to unintended external domains

3. **`/server/controllers/userController.js`**
   - Likely contains additional email sending functionality

### Risk Assessment

**Likelihood**: Low to Medium
- The vulnerability requires a specially crafted email address to exploit
- Depends on whether user input is validated before being used in email addresses

**Impact**: Medium to High
- Password reset emails being sent to wrong addresses could lead to account takeovers
- Verification emails sent to external domains could prevent legitimate user registration
- Sensitive user data could be exposed to unintended recipients

## Remediation Plan

### Immediate Actions Required

1. **Update nodemailer package** from `^6.9.12` to `^7.0.9` or later
   ```bash
   cd server
   npm install nodemailer@^7.0.9
   ```

2. **Review email address validation**
   - Ensure all email addresses are validated before use
   - Add validation to reject email addresses with unusual quoted local-parts
   - Consider implementing allowlist for acceptable email formats

3. **Test email functionality**
   - Verify password reset emails work correctly
   - Verify registration/verification emails work correctly
   - Test edge cases with various email formats

### Long-term Recommendations

1. **Input Validation**: Implement strict email validation for all user inputs
2. **Security Testing**: Add automated tests for email address parsing edge cases
3. **Monitoring**: Log all email operations for audit purposes
4. **Regular Updates**: Keep dependencies up to date with automated dependency scanning

## Verification Steps

After updating the package:

1. Run existing tests: `npm test`
2. Manually test email sending functionality:
   - User registration
   - Email verification
   - Password reset
3. Check for any breaking changes in nodemailer 7.x API

## Conclusion

This vulnerability should be addressed promptly to prevent potential email misrouting and data leakage. The fix is straightforward and involves updating to a patched version of nodemailer. While the likelihood of exploitation may be low in typical usage scenarios, the potential impact justifies immediate remediation.
