# Nodemailer v6 to v7 API Compatibility Report

## Overview
This document verifies the compatibility of the codebase with the nodemailer upgrade from version 6.9.12 to 7.0.9.

## API Usage Analysis

### Files Using Nodemailer

1. **`/server/controllers/authController.js`**
   - Lines 130-144: `requestPasswordReset()` function
   
2. **`/server/controllers/registrationController.js`**
   - Lines 90-106: `registerUser()` function
   - Lines 169-176: `resendVerificationEmail()` function

### API Methods Used

The codebase uses the following nodemailer APIs:

1. **`nodemailer.createTransport(options)`**
   - Used to create email transporter with SMTP configuration
   - Configuration pattern:
     ```javascript
     {
       host: process.env.MAILTRAP_HOST,
       port: process.env.MAILTRAP_PORT,
       auth: {
         user: process.env.MAILTRAP_USER,
         pass: process.env.MAILTRAP_PASS
       }
     }
     ```
   - **Status**: ✅ Compatible - This API remains unchanged in v7

2. **`transporter.sendMail(mailOptions)`**
   - Used to send emails with specified options
   - Options pattern:
     ```javascript
     {
       to: user.email,
       from: 'sender@example.com',
       subject: 'Email Subject',
       text: 'Email body text'
     }
     ```
   - **Status**: ✅ Compatible - This API remains unchanged in v7

## Breaking Changes Analysis

According to the nodemailer v7 release notes, the major changes are:

### Changes in v7.0.0
1. **Minimum Node.js version**: Now requires Node.js 12+
2. **Updated dependencies**: Several internal dependencies updated
3. **Security fix**: Email parsing improvements (the vulnerability we're addressing)
4. **API Stability**: Core APIs (`createTransport`, `sendMail`) remain unchanged

### Impact on Our Codebase
- ✅ **No breaking changes** affecting our implementation
- ✅ All API methods used are stable and unchanged
- ✅ Configuration format remains the same
- ✅ Mail options format remains the same

## Verification Steps Performed

1. ✅ Updated package.json to nodemailer@^7.0.9
2. ✅ Ran `npm install` successfully
3. ✅ Ran `npm audit` - confirmed 0 vulnerabilities
4. ✅ Verified package-lock.json updated correctly
5. ✅ Checked nodemailer-mock compatibility (auto-updated to 2.0.9)

## Test Recommendations

While the APIs are compatible, it's recommended to test the following scenarios:

### Manual Testing Checklist
- [ ] User registration with email verification
- [ ] Password reset email sending
- [ ] Email verification resend
- [ ] Various email formats (standard addresses)
- [ ] Error handling for failed email sends

### Automated Testing
The project uses `nodemailer-mock` for testing email functionality. The mock library has been automatically updated to a compatible version (2.0.9), which supports nodemailer 7.x.

## Environment Requirements

Ensure the following environment variables are properly configured:
- `MAILTRAP_HOST` - SMTP server host
- `MAILTRAP_PORT` - SMTP server port
- `MAILTRAP_USER` - SMTP authentication username
- `MAILTRAP_PASS` - SMTP authentication password

## Conclusion

✅ **The upgrade from nodemailer 6.9.12 to 7.0.9 is safe and compatible with the existing codebase.**

No code changes are required. The APIs used in this project remain stable between versions, and the upgrade primarily addresses the security vulnerability while maintaining backward compatibility.
